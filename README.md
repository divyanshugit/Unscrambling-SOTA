## 1. EfficientNet
----
**EfficientNet** is a convolutional neural network architecture and scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a compound coefficient. Unlike conventional practice that arbitrary scales these factors, the EfficientNet scaling method uniformly scales network width, depth, and resolution with a set of fixed scaling coefficients.

## 2. Word2Vec
---
***Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space*** was the paper in which Word2Vec was indtroduced for the first time. In this paper, researchers proposed two novel model architectures for computing continuous vector representations of words from very large data sets. The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks.
